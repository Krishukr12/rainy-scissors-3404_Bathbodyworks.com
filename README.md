# End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we have tried to  clone  the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us 
experiences and we have learned lots of things in React, Redux by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence in the Tech stack which we have used. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

# Limitations
Pages are not responsive yet, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as we were given only 5 days to clone the website.
